= Quick Tour

Morphia wraps the MongoDB Java driver so some level of familiarity with using the driver can be helpful.
Morphia does its best to abstract much of that away but if something is confusing, please consult the Java driver http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/[documentation] as well.

The following code snippets come from the {srcRef}/examples/src/test/java/dev/morphia/example/QuickTour.java[QuickTour.java]
example code that can be found with the http://morphia.dev/morphia[Morphia source].

== Setting up Morphia

The following example shows how to create the initial Morphia instance.
Using this instance, you can configure various aspects of how Morphia maps your entities and validates your queries.

[source,java]
----
final Datastore datastore = Morphia.createDatastore(MongoClients.create(), "morphia_example");
// tell Morphia where to find your classes
// can be called multiple times with different packages or classes
datastore.getMapper().mapPackage("dev.morphia.example");

datastore.ensureIndexes();
----

This snippet creates the Morphia instance we'll be using in our simple application.
The `Morphia` class is a factor for `Datastore`
instances, if you will.
There are several values we can pass in to create a `Datastore` but the absolute minimum is the name of the database you would like to connect to.
If this is all you pass in, Morphia will create a `Datastore` that connects to the named database on the local machine using the default port of `27017`.
However, outside of tests this isn't usually enough.
There are two other items you might pass in as well: a `MongoClient` reference to use when connecting to the database and a `MapperOptions`
reference to configure how the mapping is done.

With the second line we're telling Morphia to look at every class in the package we've given and find every class annotated with xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Entity.html#[`@Entity`] (which we'll cover shortly) or xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Embedded.html#[`@Embedded`] and register the mapping metadata we've put on our classes.
This method can be called multiple times to cover all your entities wherever they might live in your application.

== Mapping Options

You can configure various mapping options via the `MapperOptions` class.
There are a number of items to configure here but for now we 'll just cover two.
For a discussion of the remainder, please see the :xref:configuration.adoc[configuration guide].
The two most common elements to configure are probably `storeEmpties` and `storeNulls`.
By default Morphia will not store empty `List` or
`Map` values nor will it store null values in to MongoDB.
If your application needs empty or null values to be present for whatever reason, setting these values to true will tell Morphia to save them for you.
There are a few other options to configure on
`MapperOptions`, but we'll not be covering them here.

== Mapping Classes

There are two ways that Morphia can handle your classes: as top level entities or embedded in others.
Any class annotated with
xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Entity.html#[`@Entity`] is treated as a top level document stored directly in a collection.
Any class with xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Entity.html#[`@Entity`] must have a field annotated with
xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Id.html#[`@Id`] to define which field to use as the `_id` value in the document written to MongoDB.  xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Embedded.html#[`@Embedded`] indicates that the class will result in a subdocument inside another document.  xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Embedded.html#[`@Embedded`] classes do not require the presence of an
xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Id.html#[`@Id `] field.

[NOTE]
====
In order to be considered for persistence by Morphia, classes *must* be annotated with either `@Entity` or `@Embedded`.
Classes lacking either of these annotations will effectively be ignored by Morphia.
====

Let's examine a more complete example:

[source,java]
----
@Entity("employees")
@Indexes(
    @Index(value = "salary", fields = @Field("salary"))
)
class Employee {
    @Id
    private ObjectId id;
    private String name;
    @Reference
    private Employee manager;
    @Reference
    private List<Employee> directReports;
    @Property("wage")
    private Double salary;
}
----

There are a few things here to discuss and others we'll defer to later sections.
This class is annotated with the
xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Entity.html#[`@Entity`] annotation so we know that it will be a top level document.
In the annotation, you'll see `"employees"`.
By default, Morphia will use the camel case class name as the collection name.
If you pass a String instead, it will use that value for the collection name.
In this case, all `Containers` instances will be saved in to the `employees`
collection instead.
There is a little more to this annotation but the xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Entity.html#[@Entity] javadoc covers those details .  xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Entity.html#[`@Entity`] should be used on any type you want Morphia to map including embedded types.
Embedded types are not required to have an xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Id.html#[`@Id`] annotated field.

The xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Indexes.html#[`@Indexes`] annotation lists which indexes Morphia should create.
In this instance, we're defining an index named `salary` on the field salary with the default ordering of ascending.
More information on indexing can found xref:indexing.adoc[here].

We've marked the `id` field to be used as our primary key (the `_id` field in the document).
In this instance we're using the Java driver type of `ObjectId` as the ID type.
The ID can be any type you'd like but is generally something like `ObjectId` or `long`.
There are two other annotations to cover but it should be pointed out now that other than transient and static fields, Morphia will attempt to copy every field to a document bound for the database.

The simplest of the two remaining annotations is xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Property.html#[`@Property`].
This annotation is entirely optional.
If you leave this annotation off, Morphia will use the Java field name as the document field name.
Often times this is fine.
However, some times you'll want to change the document field name.
In those cases, you can use
xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Property.html#[`@Property`] and pass it the name to be used when this class is serialized out to the database.

This just leaves xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/annotations/Reference.html#[`@Reference`].
This annotation is telling Morphia that this field refers to other Morphia mapped entities.
In this case Morphia will store what MongoDB calls a
{docsRef}/reference/database-references/#dbrefs[`DBRef`] which is just a collection name and key value.
These referenced entities must already be saved or at least have an ID assigned or Morphia will throw an exception.

[NOTE]
====
There is a newer approach for defining references that is explained more fully xref:indexing.adoc[here].

== Saving Data

For the most part, you treat your Java objects just like you normally would.
When you're ready to write an object to the database, it's as simple as this:

[source,java]
----
final Employee elmer = new Employee("Elmer Fudd", 50000.0);
datastore.save(elmer);
----

Taking it one step further, lets define some relationships and save those, too.

[source,java]
----
final Employee daffy = new Employee("Daffy Duck", 40000.0);
datastore.save(daffy);

final Employee pepe = new Employee("Pepé Le Pew", 25000.0);
datastore.save(pepe);

elmer.getDirectReports().add(daffy);
elmer.getDirectReports().add(pepe);

datastore.save(elmer);
----

As you can see, we just need to create and save the other Employees then we can add them to the direct reports list and save.
Morphia takes care of saving the keys in Elmer's document that refer to Daffy and Pepé.
Updating data in MongoDB is as simple as updating your Java objects and then calling `datastore.save()` with them again.
For bulk updates (e.g., everyone gets a raise!) this is not the most efficient way of doing updates.
It is possible to update directly in the database without having to pull in every document, convert to Java objects, update, convert back to a document, and write back to MongoDB.But in order to show you that piece, first we need to see how to query.

== Querying

Morphia attempts to make your queries as type safe as possible.
All of the details of converting your data are handled by Morphia directly and only rarely do you need to take additional action.
As with everything else, `Datastore` is where we start:

[source,java]
----
final Query<Employee> query = datastore.find(Employee.class);
final List<Employee> employees = query.iterator().toList();
----

This is a basic Morphia query.
Here, we're telling the `Datastore` to create a query that's been typed to `Employee`.
In this case, we're fetching every `Employee` in to a `List`.
For very large query results, this could very well be too much to fit in to memory.
For this simple example, using `toList()` is fine but in practice `iterator()` is usually the more appropriate choice.
In those cases, rather than calling `iterator()` directly, it's sufficient to simply iterate a `Query` using a for loop and let the magic of `Iterable`
do its thing.
Most queries will, of course, want to filter the data in some way.
Here's how to do that:

[source,java]
----
underpaid = datastore.createQuery(Employee.class)
                     .filter(Filters.lte("salary", 30000))
                     .iterator()
                     .toList();
----

Morphia supports all the query filters defined in the Mongodb query language.
You can find helper methods for all these filers on the
xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/query/filters/Filters.html#[Filters class].
The `filter()` method can take as many `Filter`
references as you need to define your query.
It can also be called multiple times as any subsequent calls are cumulative with the rest of the filters already defined.

== Updates

Now that we can query, however simply, we can turn to in-database updates.
These updates take two components: a query, and a set of update operations.
In this example, we'll find all the underpaid employees and give them a raise of 10000. The first step is to create the query to find all the underpaid employees.
This is one we've already seen:

[source,java]
----
final Query<Employee> underPaidQuery = datastore.find(Employee.class)
                                                .filter(Filters.lte("salary", 30000));
----

To define how we want to update the documents matched by this query, we can call `update()` on our query:

[source,java]
----
final UpdateResult results = underPaidQuery.update()
                                           .inc("salary", 10000)
                                           .execute();
----

There are many operations on this class but, in this case, we're only updating the `salary` field by `10000`.
This corresponds to the
{docsRef}/reference/operator/update/inc/[`$inc`] operator.
The `UpdateResult` instance returned will contain various statistics about the update operation.

== Removes

After everything else, removes are really quite simple.
Removing just needs a query to find and delete the documents in question and then call `delete()` the remove them from the database:

[source,java]
----
datastore.find(Employee.class)
         .filter(Filters.gt("salary", 100000))
         .delete(new DeleteOptions()
                .multi(true));
----

Take note of the `DeleteOptions` being passed in here.
By default, mongodb will only delete the first matching document.
If you want to delete all of them, you need to pass the `multi(true)` option as well.
