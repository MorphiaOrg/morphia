= Transactions

Starting with MongoDB version 4.0, multi-document transactions are now supported on replica sets.
Morphia 2.0 introduces a simple mechanism to access this functionality.
Morphia 2.0 adds the methods `withTransaction(MorphiaTransaction<T> transaction)` and
`withTransaction(ClientSessionOptions options, MorphiaTransaction<T> transaction)` allowing for the execution of logic scoped to a transaction.

The API is designed to work with Java 8's lambda syntax for the most convenience.
In this example, let's assume we're building a shopping site.

[source,java]
----
User account = datastore.withTransaction((session) -> {
    User user = new User("jimbo", "jimhalpert@dundermifflin.com");
    user.setHomeAddress(new Address("123 Paper Lane", "Scranton", "PA", "18510"));

    return session.save(user);
});
----

In this simple example, we're starting with our standard `Datastore` and calling `withTransaction()`.
The lambda we're passing in executes all with the scope of a single transaction.
You'll note the single parameter passed in is a `MorphiaSession`.
This is actually a `Datastore` but it has been bound to a session.
Any changes to be made within the transaction should be made using this
`session` reference.
Once the lambda returns, the transaction is automatically committed and the session closed.
If you need access to server session or the transaction, there are methods on `MorphiaSession` to return either of those.

Of course, it's not always possible to wrap things up neatly inside a lambda so let's take a look at more hands on approach:

[source,java]
----
MorphiaSession session = datastore.startSession();
session.startTransaction();
User user = new User("jimbo", "jimhalpert@dundermifflin.com");
user.setHomeAddress(new Address("123 Paper Lane", "Scranton", "PA", "18510"));
session.save(user);
session.commitTransaction();
session.close();
----

This is essentially the same logic as above but now we're manually managing the transactional boundaries.  `MorphiaSession` is also
`AutoCloseable` so you could wrap the entire block in a `try-with-resources` block and let that manage the session boundary for you:

[source,java]
----
try(MorphiaSession session = datastore.startSession()) {
    session.startTransaction();
    User user = new User("jimbo", "jimhalpert@dundermifflin.com");
    user.setHomeAddress(new Address("123 Paper Lane", "Scranton", "PA", "18510"));
    session.save(user);
    session.commitTransaction();
}
