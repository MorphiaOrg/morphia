== Deletes

Queries are used to delete documents from the database as well.
Using
xref:javadoc:dev/morphia/query/Query.html#delete()#[`Query#delete()`], we can delete documents matching the query.
The default operation will only delete the first matching document.
However, you can opt to delete all matches by passing in the appropriate options:

[source,java]

datastore
    .find(Hotel.class)
    .filter(gt("stars", 100))
    .delete(new DeleteOptions()
                     .multi(true));
